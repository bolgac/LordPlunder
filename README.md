# Lord Plunder — Pillage Captured Lords After Battle

![Mod Banner](Media/banner.jpg)

## Description
**Lord Plunder** adds an immersive post-battle mechanic to *Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord*.  
After each battle, if you capture enemy lords, you can now **pillage them**, **show mercy**, or soon **demand ransom** — every choice affects your **relations, charm, and wealth**.

---

## Features
- Plunder all captured lords or choose them individually  
- Gain random loot and gold based on each lord’s wealth  
- Show mercy to increase relations and charm  
- Execute lords to seize all their items and gold  
- Dynamic relation effects (−3 to +5) depending on your choice  

---

## Gameplay Mechanics

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Plunder Lord** | - Relation: −0 to −3 <br> - Loot: 2-6 random items (Common → Epic) <br> - Gold: 2%–10% of lord’s total wealth |
| **Show Mercy** | - Relation: +1 to +5 <br> - Charm: increases slightly |
| **Execute Lord** | - Gain all items and gold |

The richer the lord, the higher the chance to get better-quality loot.

---

## Upcoming Features
- **Options Menu (Mod Configuration):** Adjust relationship impact, loot range, and gold percentages  
- **Ransom System:** Request ransom instead of plundering  
- **Diplomacy Integration:** Lords may seek revenge for plundering  
- **Custom Event Dialogs:** New scenes and UI polish
