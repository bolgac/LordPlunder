# 🏰 Lord Plunder — Pillage Captured Lords After Battle

![Mod Banner](Media/banner.jpg)

## ⚔️ Description
**Lord Plunder** adds an immersive post-battle mechanic to *Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord*.  
After each battle, if you capture enemy lords, you can now **pillage them**, **show mercy**, or soon **demand ransom** — every choice affects your **relations, charm, and wealth**.

---

## 🎮 Features
- 🪓 Plunder all captured lords or choose them individually  
- 💰 Gain random loot and gold based on each lord’s wealth  
- ❤️ Show mercy to increase relations and charm  
- ☠️ Execute lords to seize all their items and gold  
- 🎲 Dynamic relation effects (−3 to +5) depending on your choice  

---

## ⚙️ Gameplay Mechanics

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Plunder Lord** | - Relation: −0 to −3 <br> - Loot: 2-6 random items (Common → Epic) <br> - Gold: 2%–10% of lord’s total wealth |
| **Show Mercy** | - Relation: +1 to +5 <br> - Charm: increases slightly |
| **Execute Lord** | - Gain all items and gold |

The richer the lord, the higher the chance to get better-quality loot.
